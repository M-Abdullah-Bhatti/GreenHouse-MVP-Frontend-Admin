export const americaPrediction = `Based on the provided data from different sheets, here are some potential contradictions or inconsistencies for Bank of America:\n\n1. Year: In the \"InsigAI\" sheet, all the entries mention the year as 2021. However, in the \"Twitter\" sheet, there are entries with different years, such as 2022 and 2018. This indicates a discrepancy in the reported years.\n\n2. Data source: The \"InsigAI\" sheet consistently mentions the data source as \"Sustainability Report Annex\" for all the entries related to Bank of America. However, in the \"Twitter\" sheet, the data source is not mentioned. This lack of consistency in reporting the data source may indicate a discrepancy.\n\n3. Scope 3 emissions: The first entry in the \"InsigAI\" sheet states that Bank of America has calculated and disclosed all relevant categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions since 2012, except for emissions from financial products and services provided to clients. However, there is no further mention of Scope 3 emissions or the methodology used in the subsequent entries. This lack of alignment and inconsistency in reporting Scope 3 emissions is a potential contradiction.\n\n4. Carbon neutrality and renewable electricity goal: Multiple entries in the \"InsigAI\" sheet mention that Bank of America achieved carbon neutrality and its 100% renewable electricity goal in 2019. However, there is no mention of this achievement in the \"Financial report\" sheet. This discrepancy raises questions about the consistency of reported achievements.\n\n5. Coal financing: One entry in the \"InsigAI\" sheet states that Bank of America plans to phase out all financing of companies deriving 25% of their revenue from thermal coal mining by 2025. However, there is no mention of this commitment in the \"Financial report\" sheet, which instead highlights Bank of America's involvement in coalitions focused on clean energy transition. This inconsistency suggests conflicting information about the bank's stance on coal financing.\n\n6. GHG emissions sources: The last entry in the \"Financial report\" sheet lists the GHG sources that constituted Bank of America's operational boundary. However, there is no consistent mention of GHG emissions or their sources in the \"InsigAI\" or \"Twitter\" sheets. This lack of alignment in reporting GHG emissions sources is a potential inconsistency.\n\nThese potential contradictions and inconsistencies between the provided information highlight the need for clarification and further analysis to ensure accurate and reliable data.`
